Through this project, I practiced:

- Using React Router for multi-page navigation.
- Using third-party API for fetching data.

- Handling cart logic (quantities, totals, edge cases).
- Writing cleaner, modular code with reusable components.
- Unit testing and test-driven development.
- Building responsive layouts.
